Hello my fellow Dragalia Lost-players! So we all know 3 characters are very very rarely worth going through the effort of building them. Which I think is a shame! Some of the 3 adventurers are pretty cool either visually or storywise. So personally I would love them seeing being buffed to a level closer to original 5 s as now. Obviously there should still be a difference between 3 , 4 and 5  But i would love to see the gap getting a chunk more narrow. First thing that could be done would. Hey there!
