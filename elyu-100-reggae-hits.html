I was going to spend some time writing a post about emo rock and its influence on modern pop music (which will still happen at some point), but before doing so I recently noticed that UKF Music was celebrating their 10th anniversary this month. They posted about it earlier this year (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiuzc7madRM), but UKF created their dubstep YouTube channel on April 29th. For those who aren’t familiar with UKF Music, they’re a big deal in the world of electronic music. Short.

(I apologize if you do not get this reference) 3- Bleh Bleh vampires. Every vampire acted like a bad version of Dracula and i loved it. They were creepy and unpredictable. 4- The Grim Reaper acted more professional and was not just another sim. 5- Ghosts were terrifying and didn't act like Roman from Gta IV 6- you could be BFFs with Bigfo.

Thanks in advance to everyone that participates. :) ___ ___ ##Men. Why? Ah, men. /r/popheads has had quite the history with the mystifying beasts. While some men have done their best to ruin this planet we live on and say it wasn’t their fault, some other men have recorded music. Music that helped define the 2010s, spawning singles. I thought some of you would appreciate this. Last week I saw a Facebook marketplace ad for 150 records for . If you did the math, that's 50 cents a record, which is a really good price. That price becomes even better when you realize what was being sold: original first pressings of punk, new wave, rock, and reggae classics. The deal improves once more when you realize that the majority of the records are UK or European pressings, i.e. better quality and worth more than the U.S. versions.

Production, however makes it sound like they were aiming more for “Club Ninja” sounds rather than a better era. To add insult to injury, the compressed guitars. I’ve been using this sub to plan a trip to Berlin in December and I wanted to give a little back. I’m skipping over the obvious museums and tourist spots, parks etc (which you should also check out and are repeated in all the main guides) and giving you my personal tips for solo travelers that might not be the most recommended in the guide books etc. I love Madrid, lived here for 4 years, I believe it’s actually one of the friendliest and safest capital cities 10 Rules For Powering Through a Hangover Fucking FAST: 1. Call Everyone You Know and Apologize: You don't know what the fuck happened last night, or who it involved, but I bet my left testicle that your idiotic rampage could be legally defined as abuse to anyone within earshot. Call everyone in your Rolodex, last name alphabetical, and personally apologize for what you may or may-not have done. The aim here is to lift your conscience and help relieve the existential dread that has been chemi. I know this will probably get removed but I'm going to try and describe the issue with excluding 65+ bands from this sub including storied groups like: The Clash Aerosmith The Ramones The Eagles Eric Clapton Michael Jackson The obvious reason for denying these artists on the HOF list (https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/wiki/halloffame) is because they are extremely popular acts. In a sub of 18.7M there are bound to be dozens of submissions for London Calling or Billie Jean in a single 1. This thing is an impossible amount of fun! I've done almost every board sport (skateboarding, wakeboarding, snowboarding, kiteboarding, and surfing), and there's nothing quite like the OneWheel. The experience is a lot like longboarding and snowboarding, except you can ride anywhere. 2. This thing is built like a tank, and I'm beating the shit out of it. 3. Coming from a skateboarding background, the footplates are way too flat. It's the first thing I noticed, it really stood How to Release an Album I have a lot of conversations with musicians who want to take their career from amateur to professional. Some want to be famous; some just want to be able to make a living from their music. Either way, it’s not easy, but it doesn’t have to be as complicated as you might think! Back in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, it was all about getting a record deal and the advance that came with that. Now, a record company won’t even look at you unless you’ve already This isn't finished, but here you go. Still trying to get back in the swing. HAPPENING THIS WEEK: The Terror of Tallahassee ( https://www.facebook.com/events/285078742216445/) Haunted House is starting back up for the season! I believe this is their 20th year, and they are definitely local favorites. Lots of spooky frights and plenty of fun. It starts this Friday, skips Saturday, and then it’ll run Friday and Saturday nights from 8-10 for the rest of the month.

I just tried TIDAL ($ 20 for uncompressed sound), because Spotify has no uncompressed sound option. Here's my test against 1 year Spotify (2017 iMac, 50 MBit): PRO: Uncompressed audio in CD quality (FLAC). You do hear the difference. There are 427 albums in "master" quality up to 96 kHz / 24 bit. https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003671329-MQA-What-it-Stands-for No matter if your soundcard supports 96 kHz, it sure does 24 bit and that makes the most difference actually. Hi there! I've always been self-taught when it comes to mixing, so I've struggled quite a bit with it. I knew how to make each channel sound good, but always applied FX to them individually, and that made my tracks feel crowded and confusing, not glued at all. Then I discovered busses.total game changer! But I'm still a bit lost on how to put each element in their space when it comes to processing, specifically drums. So for example, I have this reggae track with each different This isn't finished. Check back for more.

A Definitive Guide to Rush (If you're curious about the history of the band, check out the documentary "Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage". It's very interesting, and a fun watch) I notice a lot of people new to this sub often ask the question "I've only listened to Rush casually, how and where should i start to get into them more?" I want to answer this question thoroughly. To answer this truthfully, however, there is no definitive way to start listening to any band. You can click The #1 Station In The Nation broadcasting 24/7.
