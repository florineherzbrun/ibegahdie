                            <p>While there are many custom ROMs out there to choose from, not all of them are stable enough to be used as your daily driver. So, if you’re someone who wants to install a custom ROM on their device but is confused about which one to go with, read on as we bring to you our list of the 12 best custom ROMs for Android that you can install. Have the APK file for an alpha, beta, or staged rollout update? Just drop it below, fill in any details you know, and we'll do the rest!

I finally managed to get Xposed on my RN4x and have been dissappointed by the outcome. So far I have only gotten youtube background playback to work.which is something I don't even really need. I have been trying to get GravityBox, materal status bar and a few others working but have had zero luck. I figured it may just be because of MIUI but was hoping to hear anyone elses experience. 资源索引 m,绿色资源网打造最放心的绿色安全下载站. I remember a long time ago for miui version 5 there was xposed module/app called miui tools by burgerz developer that had many little cosmetic tweaks under one roof. Is there something like that now for miui 10? For example I would like to have the clock in the middle of the status bar but it seems you can only have this if it was built as an option inside the custom rom. Or if you try the miglobe app for center clock then it messes up the built-in options from the custom rom. It seems Download the song of Рита Дакота — Перчатки, listen to the track, watch clip and find lyrics. Я на твой нечаянно кинула бабла, потому что свой знаю хуже. When I was on MIUI 8, it was possible using the module xMIUI/MIUI Tweaks. Ever since I have updated to MIUI 9, they no longer function. I have tried 'Fingerprint Quick Action' but it too doesn't seem to work. Is there any other alternative? Edit: Solved the issue. Xposed Edge works flawlessly. GravityBox doesn't  I know it's a popular answer - just install LOS or other custom ROM. And I somewhat agree with this sentiment, but at the same time there are some minor and not so minor bugs (random reboots for example), yellow flash light, worse battery life and issues with updating (every LOS update messes up my Gapps and I end up having to clean flash =_=). So back to my initial question - what tweaks, Xposed modules, root tools do you use to make MIUI more bearable? I'm asking for Redmi 
Hi guys, I'm planning on buying this phone, but I'm unsure of which variant to buy I am a power user, I like customising my phones, but if I'm happy with MIUI (never used before) then I'll keep it My main features I would like to see are decent battery life, reliable push notifications, and such I've read that the MediaTek variant has worse battery life and support. Is this true? I understand Snapdragon has a bigger following, but the MediaTek version seems to have a few (not many, but there. PSA: There appears to be a growing issue with devices 'dying' when connected to a computer. It does not appear to be affecting a large number of people but I have been asked by members of the community to make this issue visible. ASUS have yet to comment. Further discussion can be found here (https://www.reddit.com/r/zenfone2/comments/3m3d0y/phone_went_dead_when_plugging_into_computer/) and here (https://www.reddit.com/r/zenfone2/comments/44xim4/i_plugged_my_zenfone_2_in_last_night_to_cha. EDIT: Clock Changes in The Tweaks app forced a crash. Disabling that part enables boot. Might just be a matter of trial and error as to what breaks it.hopefully we get an update soon. Thanks I've just installed Xposed on a RN4X running MIUI 9, Android 7.0 with Magisk. I was able to boot in, check that Xposed was installed and activated without issue. I activated a module (MIUI Tweaks), rebooted and I'm on a blank/black scrren. Option to reboot show-up if I hold the power button This probably comes up regularly. Notifications on miui 8 aren't exactly great, I'm used to expanding notifications with one finger, Xiaomi in their wisdom do this with 2 fingers. I've tried searching for some apps and found one or two but I don't know if they will work as I don't have exposed installed. There's also miui 8 tweaks and xmiui Has anyone had any succes. My last review was of the Unoffical CM13 by SultanXDA (https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/5igfsj/oneplus_3_rom_reviews_part_2_cm_13_by_sultanxda/).This time, i've got the official Resurrection Remix ROM of Android Marshmallow. It's a CM based ROM so it'll have the bugs carried over from CM. But it also has a ton of customizations. # Launcher Again, we have the stock Trebuchet Launcher here. So this section is more or less same to my previous ROM review. The launcher itself lacks. 
Hello there! It's been a while since my last set of infographics. Mostly because I've decided to wait for the next wave of ROMs that incorporate 4.4 (and now 4.4.1). I am most excited for Paranoid Android since that was my daily driver on my Nexus 4. I am also looking forward to flashing CM11 onto my Nexus 5 and giving it a spin. For this update, I've decided to do a quick one on something different. Many people commented while looking through my infographics that they were not really "wowed".
